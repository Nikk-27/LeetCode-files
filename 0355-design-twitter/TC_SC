1. post_tweet Function

Time Complexity:

Checking if userId is in user_map: O(1), because checking key existence in a hash map (Python's dict) is O(1).
If the user does not exist, creating a new User object: O(1).
Adding a tweet (inserting at the head of the deque): O(1).
Total Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity:

The tweet is stored in the tweets deque, and a User object is added to the user_map if it doesn't already exist.
Each new tweet takes O(1) space, and creating a new User object takes O(1) space.
Total Space Complexity: O(1) for each tweet.

2. get_news_feed Function

Time Complexity:

Loop over followers: Let's assume that a user has F followers.

For each follower, you add their tweets to the priority queue (max 10 tweets). This operation involves pushing elements into a heap.
Adding a tweet to the priority queue (heapq.heappush) takes O(log k), where k is the size of the heap, and the heap size is bounded by 10 since we are only interested in the top 10 tweets.
Hence, for each follower, adding up to 10 tweets takes O(10 * log 10) = O(10). For F followers, this becomes O(10 * F).
Own tweets: Similarly, adding up to 10 of the user's own tweets takes O(10 * log 10) = O(10).

Extracting tweets: You pop up to 10 tweets from the priority queue, each taking O(log 10). Thus, this step takes O(10 * log 10) = O(10).

Total Time Complexity: O(10 * F) for adding follower tweets + O(10) for adding own tweets = O(F).

Note: The constant factor 10 arises because we limit the number of tweets considered from each user to 10, and the priority queue never grows beyond size 10.
Space Complexity:

Priority Queue (Heap): The size of the heap is limited to 10 because we only store up to 10 tweets at any given time.
Hence, the space complexity for the heap is O(10) = O(1).
Total Space Complexity: O(1), since we limit the heap to a maximum of 10 elements.

3. follow Function

Time Complexity:

Checking if followerId and followeeId exist in user_map: O(1) for each.
If they don't exist, creating a new User object: O(1) for each.
Adding a followee to the follower's followers set: O(1).
Total Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity:

Storing a new follower in the followers set: O(1).
Adding new User objects (if they don't exist): O(1) each.
Total Space Complexity: O(1)


4. unfollow Function

Time Complexity:

Checking if followerId and followeeId exist in user_map: O(1) for each.
Removing a followee from the followers set: O(1).
Total Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity:

No new space is allocated; only an element is removed from the set.
Total Space Complexity: O(1)



Overall Complexity
Time Complexity Summary:

post_tweet: O(1)
get_news_feed: O(F), where F is the number of followers of the user.
follow: O(1)
unfollow: O(1)
Space Complexity Summary:

post_tweet: O(1) per tweet.
get_news_feed: O(1), since the priority queue (heap) is capped at 10 elements.
follow: O(1)
unfollow: O(1)
Conclusion
The overall time complexity for the get_news_feed function is O(F), where F is the number of followers of the user, because you're potentially processing up to 10 tweets for each follower.
The space complexity is optimized to O(1) due to the limitation of the priority queue size to 10. Other operations like post_tweet, follow, and unfollow are O(1) for both time and space.
