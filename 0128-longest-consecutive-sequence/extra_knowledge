Final Complexity Summary
Case	                         Set Operation Time	Overall Complexity
Average case with unordered_set	  O(1)	            O(N)
Worst case with unordered_set	    O(N)	            O(N²)
Using ordered set (RB tree)	      O(log N)	        O(N log N)



Conclusion
- The expected complexity is O(N), assuming efficient set operations.
- In the worst case, it can degrade to O(N²) due to hash collisions.
- Using an ordered set (like a BST) results in O(N log N) complexity.
